grub2 (1.96+20090604-1) unstable; urgency=low

Before this version grub-efi was 32bit on i386 and 64bit on amd64.
But EFI can be 32bit even if you have a 64bit CPU like in the first MacBook
models with Core 2 Duo released end of 2006.
So grub-efi has been now split into grub-efi-amd64 and grub-efi-ia32 which are
on both amd64 and i386 avaible.

If it didn't work before because it failed to load the grub.efi you can try out
now the other package as your used CPU archictecture.

The downside of this is that now all binaries are prefixed with i386-pe or
amd64-pe. For example grub-install is now called i386-pe-grub-install in
grub-efi-ia32 and amd64-pe-grub-install in grub-efi-amd64.
