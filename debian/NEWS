grub2 (1.96+20090604-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Before this version, grub-efi was 32bit on i386 and 64bit on amd64.
  However, EFI can be 32bit even if you have a 64bit CPU, like in the
  first MacBook models with Core 2 Duo released in late 2006.  Thus,
  grub-efi has been split into grub-efi-amd64 and grub-efi-ia32 which are
  available on both amd64 and i386.
  
  If you've experienced problems trying to load grub.efi, please try
  again using the package that doesn't match your CPU's architecture.

  The downside of this is that all binaries are now prefixed with
  i386-pe or amd64-pe. For example, grub-install is now called
  i386-pe-grub-install in grub-efi-ia32, and amd64-pe-grub-install in
  grub-efi-amd64.
